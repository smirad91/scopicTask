Task 4 - documentation:


    Tools:
    - testlink - for writing manual test cases
    - Selenium WebDriver in python - for automation testing of web site
        - I would use packages in python that I created during my work in automation testing. Packages names:
        selenium-logging for logging to HTML, and testOrganizer for sorting, executing and reporting tests.
    - python - for API testing
    - jira - for reporting bugs


    Tests from manual test cases should be automated, where priority would be tests for core features (for amazon: login, register, search,
    shop by department, add to chart, create item to sell, emails).
     Then tests that frequently fails while manual testing. Then tests that take too long for tester to run
    them manually.

    How test framework folder structure would be organized:
    - Lib
        -basic - contains method that are not web site specific, like creating browser, get info from json file
        -amazon - contains methods for amazon web site, divided in files (LoginPage, RegisterPage, MainPage)
        -reqres - containt methods for APIs
    -Tests
        -amazon - automated tests for GUI
        -reqres - automated tests for API
